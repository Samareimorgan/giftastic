# Muppets Take Over the Web

## About

Why Muppets?  
Muppets have been in American culture for over 30 years. They are an American Icon that brings to people of all ages. This muppets giphy search was created to help bring fun and joy to people. 

## The Functionality
The muppets take over the web application utilizes the Giphy API to request Muppet Giphys and then adds up to 10 Giphys dynamically to the web page.  The Giphy is requested using an AJAX get call.   The Giphy is paused once rendered on the page; however once the Giphy is clicked on, the Giphy begins to play. A user can pause or un-pause the Giphy at any time. 

The user can request muppet giphys by pressing the buttons already provided. The user can also create a new muppet button by entering a muppet name in the search input, and press search.  At this point a button is dynamically created and added to the end of the current list of buttons.  When the user clicks on the new button,  it will complete an AJAX get call, like the other buttons.  

## Technology 
This web application used Javascript, Jquery, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap.
